Model for Fashion_MNIST Dataset using KERAS API --- Accuracy 99.50%    
===============================================================
In the Fashion_MNIST notebook a model(classifier) is built using Convolutional Neural Network architecture.
After training on the Fashion MNIST, the model achieved an accuracy of 99.50%.
The architecture of the classifier is pretty simple and straight forward i.e. a direct application of CNN using Keras API. 

List of classes for the index value in the dataset :

0: T-shirt/top

1: Trouser

2: Pullover

3: Dress

4: Coat

5: Sandal

6: Shirt

7: Sneaker

8: Bag

9: Ankle boot
