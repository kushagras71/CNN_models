Classifier for CIFAR 10 Dataset
=
CIFAR 10 is a built-in dataset in keras which is widely for understanding the Convolutional Neural Network Arichtecture 
working with  3-color channel scheme (RGB) images. 
 
 The images are randomly aligned which belong to 10 different classes.
 
 The default shapeof the images are (32,32,3)
 
 After spliting the dataset into trian and test the shape of the 4 variable will be:

x_trian - (50000,32,32,3)  


 
 
 x_test  - (10000,32,32,3)
 
 
 
 y_train - (50000,)
 


 y_test  - (10000,)
 
The classes and sample images of CIFAR 10 dataset are as follow:
